# Work Experiences 

## Cyber Security Intern |  Avanteia | May-2024  - July 2024(3 months)
### I did a three-month internship at Avanteia. I learned about various website attacks, such as SQLI, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, Business Logic Vulnerabilities, Brute force, Clickjacking, and Path Traversal. I also learned how to gather info about a website. I used scanning tools, such as  OWASP ZAP, OpenVAS,  and WPscan. I am familiar with Windows, Kali Linux, and Parrot OS. I am also familiar with Burp Suite, Metasploit, Nmap, etc.

## 1. Port Scanner 
### Description: Developed a custom port scanner to scan specified hosts and port ranges, identifying open and closed ports using Python.

## Key Features:

 - ### Socket Programming: Established connections with target ports.
 - ### Multi-threading: Accelerated scans by processing multiple ports simultaneously.
 - ### Timeout/Error Handling: Included mechanisms to manage slow connections and errors.

## Technologies: <h3> Python, socket, threading, colorama, pyfiglet, <h3>

## Skills:<h3>Enhanced Python, networking, multi-threading, performance optimization.</h3>









Encryption and Decryption using RSA and Fernet
Developed encryption and decryption functionality using RSA (asymmetric encryption) and Fernet (symmetric encryption).

Cybersecurity Tools 
Created an educational video on cybersecurity tools including Nmap, Nikto, BeEf, OpenSSL, tcpick, Wireshark, etc. demonstrating their usage in penetration testing, vulnerability scanning, and network analysis.

<h2>Random Password Generator</h2>
<h3>Developed a tool that generates random passwords with different types of characters.</h3>

<h2>Keylogger (Educational Tool)</h2>
<h3>GitHub Link: (https://lnkd.in/ggVcQ9uMi)</h3>
<h3>  -  Developed a simple keylogger in Python using the pynput library to record keyboard input for educational purposes.</h3>
<h3>  -  Focused on understanding input event handling, Python programming, and the ethical implications of security tools.</h3>
<h3>  -  Emphasized responsible usage by ensuring the tool was only for educational use and with proper consent.</h3>
<h3>  -  Gained experience in Python, security ethics, and software design.</h3>
<h3>  -  Note: Tool is intended for educational purposes only and is intended to be used with explicit permission.</h3>
